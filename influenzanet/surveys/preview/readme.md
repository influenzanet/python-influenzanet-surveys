# Survey Preview

Survey preview is a simplified version of Influenzanet survey dedicated to export data (more like a data dictionnary)

The survey structure is simplified with a linearized list of questions (without question group). The question description is only focused to the response components, with a simplified view. 
Only a single language is exported in the survey preview.
